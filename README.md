# SEO-scripts
Some Python scripts I use for auditing, research and lead generation.

How to use Compare.py:

You'll need to install Python >= 3.4

Get an API key from: http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html

Download compare.py and alchemyAPI.py. Edit compare.py to add your key and urls.

Run from Python command line.

Coming soon: Command line options to 1) add a key (writes to text file) 2) Specify URLs 3) Do a full single page comparison.

Future Possibilities: Compile to binary for windows, implement more functions such as a crawler and tree display for page results. Use a flask server to display as local webapp.
